ld1     {v2.4s}, [x0, #16]              // dy_offsets: [-1, 0, 1, 0]

dup     v3.4s, w19                      // Broadcast current_x
dup     v4.4s, w20                      // Broadcast current_y

add     v5.4s, v3.4s, v1.4s             // Calculate all neighbor_x

## Algorithm Implementation Details

### Power Grid Flood-Fill

1. **Initialization**:
   - Clear existing power grid using NEON vectorization
   - Initialize BFS queue with power plant locations
   - Set source cells to full power level (1.0)

2. **Propagation**:
   - BFS traversal with distance-based power decay
   - Vectorized neighbor coordinate calculation
   - SIMD bounds checking for grid boundaries
   - Power level updates with floating-point decay

3. **Distance Decay**:
   ```assembly
   fdiv    s3, s1, s2                      // distance_ratio = distance / max_distance
   fmov    s4, #1.0
   fsub    s4, s4, s3                      // power_drop = 1.0 - distance_ratio
   fmul    s4, s4, s5                      // Apply decay_factor
   ```

### Water System Flood-Fill

- Similar algorithm structure to power grid
- Different propagation distances (15 cells vs 20 for power)
- Water pressure decay instead of power level decay
- Separate grid fields for water coverage

### Queue Management

```assembly
// High-performance circular queue
str     w0, [x5, x4, lsl #2]            // Store value at tail
add     x4, x4, #1                      // Increment tail
csel    x4, xzr, x4, eq                 // Wrap around if needed
```
