## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components

### 1. Communication System
- **Message Queue**: Lock-free priority-based message passing
- **Communication Bus**: Bidirectional channels between all agents
- **Protocol**: Standardized message format with timestamps and correlation IDs
- **Routing**: Agent 0 serves as central hub for all inter-agent communication

### 2. Conflict Prevention
- **File Ownership Registry**: Prevents simultaneous editing conflicts
- **Resource Locking**: Coordinated access to shared resources
- **Merge Coordination**: Orchestrated integration of agent outputs
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection and resolution protocols

### 3. Task Management
- **Task Distribution**: Orchestrator assigns work based on agent specialization
- **Dependency Tracking**: Manages inter-task dependencies
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time task progress tracking
- **Milestone Coordination**: Synchronized integration points

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- **Agent Health**: CPU, memory, and task load monitoring
- **System Metrics**: Overall performance tracking
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identifies performance constraints
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizes resource distribution
