## 🔧 Advanced Feature Implementation

### 1. **Semantic Versioning Excellence**
```c
// Enhanced version structure with enterprise features
typedef struct {
    uint32_t major, minor, patch, build;    // Standard semantic versioning
    uint32_t flags;                         // 15+ stability and feature flags
    uint64_t timestamp;                     // Creation timestamp
    uint64_t hash;                          // Integrity verification hash
} hmr_version_t;

// Version flags for comprehensive lifecycle management
HMR_VERSION_STABLE | HMR_VERSION_LTS | HMR_VERSION_SECURITY | 
HMR_VERSION_BREAKING | HMR_VERSION_DEPRECATED | HMR_VERSION_EXPERIMENTAL
```

### 2. **Intelligent Compatibility Engine**
```c
// Multi-dimensional compatibility analysis
hmr_version_compatibility_t compatibility = hmr_version_check_compatibility(
    required_version, available_version, &result
);

// Automatic action recommendations
if (result.actions & ACTION_MIGRATION_AUTO) {
    hmr_execute_automatic_migration(...);
} else if (result.actions & ACTION_BACKUP_REQUIRED) {
    hmr_create_rollback_state(...);
}
```

### 3. **Enterprise Migration Pipeline**
```c
// Multi-phase migration with full error recovery
hmr_migration_context_t ctx = {
    .strategy = HMR_MIGRATION_AUTO,
    .timeout_ms = 30000,
    .flags = MIGRATION_FLAG_BACKUP | MIGRATION_FLAG_VERIFY | 
             MIGRATION_FLAG_ROLLBACK_ON_FAIL
};

int result = hmr_version_migrate(from_version, to_version, module_data, &ctx);
```

### 4. **Advanced Rollback System**
```c
// Multi-point rollback with state compression
hmr_rollback_handle_t* handle = hmr_save_rollback_state(version, module_data);

// Failed migration recovery
if (migration_failed) {
    hmr_restore_rollback_state(handle);  // Instant recovery
}
```
