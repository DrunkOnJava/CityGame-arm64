typedef struct __attribute__((aligned(64))) {
    hmr_state_chunk_t header;
    void* data;                     // Main chunk data
    void* compressed_data;          // Optional compressed storage
    void* backup_data;              // Rollback capability

ldp q4, q5, [x1, x19]         // Load new_data[0:31]  
ldp q6, q7, [x1, x19, #32]    // Load new_data[32:63]

eor.16b v16, v0, v4           // Compare chunks with XOR
