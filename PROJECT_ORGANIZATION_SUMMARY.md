# SimCity ARM64 - Project Organization Summary

## ✅ Completed Reorganization Tasks

### 1. Directory Structure
Created a clean, professional directory structure:
```
simcity-arm64/
├── assets/               # Game assets
│   ├── sprites/         # 2D sprite assets
│   ├── models/          # 3D model assets
│   └── textures/        # Texture files
├── build/               # Build outputs
│   ├── release/         # Release builds
│   └── debug/           # Debug builds
├── demos/               # Demo applications
│   ├── graphics/        # Graphics demos
│   ├── interactive/     # Interactive demos
│   └── assembly/        # Assembly test demos
├── docs/                # Documentation
├── include/             # Header files
├── scripts/             # Build and utility scripts
│   ├── build/           # Build scripts
│   ├── test/            # Test scripts
│   └── utility/         # Utility scripts
├── src/                 # Source code
├── tests/               # Test suites
└── archive/             # Archived/obsolete files
```

### 2. File Organization
- ✅ Moved all demo executables to `demos/` subdirectories
- ✅ Moved source files to appropriate directories
- ✅ Archived obsolete files and object files
- ✅ Organized scripts into categorized subdirectories
- ✅ Consolidated documentation files

### 3. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with project overview
- ✅ Established GUIDELINES.md with development standards
- ✅ Added LICENSE file (MIT)
- ✅ Created CONTRIBUTING.md for contributors
- ✅ Updated TODO.md with current project status
- ✅ Maintained CLAUDE.md for AI assistant context

### 4. Build System
- ✅ Created `scripts/build/build_all.sh` for building all components
- ✅ Organized CMakeLists.txt in root
- ✅ Set up proper .gitignore

### 5. Clean Root Directory
The root directory now contains only essential files:
- Configuration files (.gitignore, .editorconfig, CMakeLists.txt)
- Core documentation (README.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)
- Main control script (simcity-ctl.sh)

## 📁 Key Locations

### Main Executable
- **Location**: `build/release/integrated_simcity`
- **Source**: `demos/interactive/integrated_simcity_fixed.m`
- **Description**: Full city simulation with all features integrated

### Demo Applications
- **Graphics Demos**: `demos/graphics/`
  - sprite_demo, visual_demo, building_demo, etc.
- **Interactive Demos**: `demos/interactive/`
  - city_grid_renderer, economic_city_test, etc.
- **Assembly Demos**: `demos/assembly/`
  - simcity_demo, debug tests, etc.

### Assets
- **Sprites**: `assets/sprites/`
- **3D Models**: `assets/models/` (to be populated from AssetsRepository)
- **Textures**: `assets/textures/`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run the build script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build/build_all.sh
   ```

2. **Launch the main simulation**:
   ```bash
   ./build/release/integrated_simcity
   ```

3. **Continue development** following the guidelines in GUIDELINES.md

## 📊 Project Statistics

- **Total Building Types**: 31
- **Simulation Features**: Economic system, time/seasons, services
- **Performance Target**: 1M+ agents at 60 FPS
- **Platform**: macOS on Apple Silicon (ARM64)
